🚀 Oasis Infobyte Internship Projects 🚀

This repository holds the exciting projects I developed during my software development internship at Oasis Infobyte. These tasks were a fantastic way to sharpen my #Java skills and dive deep into problem-solving! ✨

Task 1: Number Guessing Game 🎯

Description:
Get ready to guess! This is a fun, console-based Number Guessing Game built with Java. 🎲 The goal is simple: guess the secret number I'm thinking of within a certain range. I'll give you hints (higher or lower! 👇👆) after each try, and we'll see how many attempts it takes you. This task was all about nailing Java fundamentals like random numbers, user input, loops, and 'if-else' statements.

Key Features:

    Generates a random secret number for you to find. 🔢
    Gives you clever hints after every guess. 😉
    Keeps tabs on your attempts so you can brag about your score. 🏆
    Play as many rounds as you want! 🔄

Technologies Used:

    Java ☕

Task 2: ATM Interface 💰💳

Description:
Welcome to your personal command-line ATM! This project is a simulation of an ATM Interface crafted in Java. 🏦 It lets you perform common banking operations like pulling out cash, depositing funds, and checking your balance. My focus here was on creating a smooth user experience, handling transactions, and making sure your account balance stays accurate in our virtual bank. It was a great exercise in applying Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts and robust input validation. ✅

Key Features:

    Deposit: Easily add money to your account. 💸
    Withdraw: Take out cash, but only if you have enough! 🛑
    Check Balance: Instantly see how much money you have. 📊
    User-friendly console interaction for a seamless experience. 👍
